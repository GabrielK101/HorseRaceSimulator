## Installation

### Part 1: Command-Line Simulation

1. **Download Project Files**: Download the entire project repository from the provided link.
   
2. **Compile RaceStarter.java**: Navigate to the directory containing the project files. Use a Java compiler to compile the `RaceStarter.java` file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```
    javac RaceStarter.java
    ```

3. **Run Command-Line Simulation**: After successful compilation, execute the compiled Java file to start the command-line simulation. Run the following command:

    ```
    java RaceStarter
    ```

    Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the command-line simulation.

### Part 2: GUI Simulation

1. **Compile RaceGUI.java**: Similar to Part 1, navigate to the directory containing the project files. Compile the `RaceGUI.java` file using a Java compiler:

    ```
    javac RaceGUI.java
    ```

2. **Run GUI Simulation**: Once compiled, execute the compiled Java file to launch the GUI simulation:

    ```
    java RaceGUI
    ```

    This will open the graphical user interface for the simulation.

## Dependencies

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run the Java files.

### Part 1: Command-Line Simulation

- **No additional dependencies**.

### Part 2: GUI Simulation

- **Java Swing Library**: The GUI simulation utilizes Java Swing for creating the graphical user interface. Java Swing is included in the standard Java Development Kit (JDK) distribution, so no additional dependencies are required.
   

## Usage

### Command-Line Simulation (Part 1)

1. **Starting the Simulation**: After compiling `RaceStarter.java`, run the command `java RaceStarter` in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Viewing the Simulation**: Once the race is started, observe the command-line output to track the progress of each horse. After each race there will be a prompt to start a new race.
### GUI Simulation (Part 2)

1. **Launching the GUI**: Compile `RaceGUI.java` and then run `java RaceGUI`. This will open the graphical user interface for the simulation.

2. **Customizing the Race**: Use the options provided in the GUI to configure the race settings, such as the number of horses and track length.

3. **Running the Race**: Click the "Start Race" button to initiate the simulation. Watch the graphical representation of the race as the horses compete for victory.

4. **Placing a bet**: Before you start a race you can optionally place a bet on a horse. First select a horse on the betting panel, enter a bet amount and palce the bet. 

5. **Interacting with the GUI**: Explore the interactive elements of the GUI, such as buttons, to control the simulation and view race results.
